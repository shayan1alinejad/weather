This is a website for an organisation called "Simple Weather". Simple Weather's vision is to make finding out the current weather forecast and the forecast for the following days as easy as possible. 
Their goal is to provide a simplistic, navigable website by removing any graphs, charts and other confusing information that the average user struggles to comprehend and replacing it with simple and 
easily understandable information that is friendly to all types of users.

The website has 1 main page. Upon entering the site, the user is greeted with a very simple but warm design and is automatically given the opportunity to enter a location to find out the forecast for the coming days.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

    - #### User Goals

        2. As a Visitor, I want to easily be able to find a search bar to input the location I want the weather forecast for.
        3. As a Visitor, I want to easily be able to find the current weather forecast for the location that I inputted in to the search bar.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The 2 colours I chose for the project was #bc7860 (A slightly desaturated orange) & #60a3bc (A slightly desaturated blue). From the beginning of the design process,
        the goal was to make the website design as simplistic as possible but the design had to be warm and welcoming to the user so they are instantly attracted to the site add
        there mind is relaxed and feels secure to ensure the best user experience. When the user loads on the page, 85% of the page height is taken up by the image that contains 
        the words "Weather Made Simple" so it was essential that the image instantly ticked off the design criteria and that the colour scheme and imagery matched and/or complimented
        one another. The Psychological effects that colours can have was a big part of deciding what colours to go with.
            - [#bc7860](https://www.color-hex.com/color/00a8ec) (Slightly desaturated orange): "Since it is a combination of red and yellow, orange is stimulating and reaction to 
            it is a combination of the physical and the emotional. It focuses our minds on issues of physical comfort - food, warmth, shelter etc. - and sensuality. It is a 'fun' 
            colour."
            - [#60a3bc](https://www.color-hex.com/color/00a8ec) (Slightly desaturated blue): "Blue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing; it affects us mentally, 
            rather than the physical reaction we have to red. Strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft blues will calm the mind and aid concentration. Consequently 
            it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication."
        - [Sessions EDU](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/): After determining that #bc7860 would be the primary colour after extracting it from the image used, Sessions EDU
        was used to find the best colour that complimented #bc7860, which in this case was #60a3bc. Sessions EDU was also used to determine what colour was monochromatic to #60a3bc
        so that it could be used on any elements such as buttons when a user hovered over them, which in this case was #3284a2 (a dark moderate blue.).
            - #bc7860 Complimentary colour - [Here](https://github.com/LouieOHagan/Simple-Weather-Website/blob/master/readMe-assets/Colour-Scheme-Complimentary.png)
            - #60a3bc Monochromatic colour - [Here](https://github.com/LouieOHagan/Simple-Weather-Website/blob/master/readMe-assets/Blue-Monochromatic-Colour.png)

    - #### Typography
        - The Raleway font is the primary font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the 
        site correctly. A lot of research went in to finding the correct font as in order to maintain the simplistic look, a very simple and light font needed to be used. The 
        font was imported in to the style.css from Google Fonts who make it very easy to to import fonts and are a very reliable external source. The Raleway font offers 9 font
        weight styles, each of which come with an italic alternative. These styles range from a font weight off 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black) however the only font weight used on the
        website was the font weight of 300 & 400. The font weight of 200 was also used on photoshop to create the simple effect and to differentiate the text "Simple" in the hero image
        text "Weather Made Simple" 
        - The Cambria was also used for the errors that showed up below the text input box in the search area with Sans Serif as the backup font in case of any issues. This font was 
        used for the errors instead of the Raleway as I felt that it stuck out a bit more and gave a bit more of an aggressive look which best suited the use.
        
    - #### Imagery
        - Imagery was a massive factor when it came to design, it always is but was especially important for this project. When the user loads on the page, 85% of the page height is 
        taken up by the image that contains the words "Weather Made Simple" so it was essential that the image instantly ticked off the design criteria, drew in the user and that 
        the colour scheme and imagery matched and/or complement one another. The image used was chosen as it was a great mix of warm and welcoming colours, the white texted
        worked really well on top of it and the colour was a unique orange that made for a great colour scheme. The weather icon images were also a big focus throughout the project 
        and a lot of time went into making them simplistic but effective.

### Further Testing
- The website was tested across a wide range of devices and browsers to ensure its fully responsive and compatible for all users.
    - Devices: The website was tested on Desktop, HP Envy Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone8, iPhoneX & Chrome Developer tools was also used to test the screen sizes of 33 devices. 
    Full list of 33 devices can be found [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LouieOHagan/Simple-Weather-Website/master/readMe-assets/Devices%20list.png)
    - Browsers: The website was tested on Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer.

- ```{behavior: "smooth"}``` in scrollIntoView function on line 56 of weather-api.js not working on many browsers.
    - After research and continuous testing I discovered that this property is not supported on many browsers, Table of compatibility found [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LouieOHagan/Simple-Weather-Website/master/readMe-assets/scrollIntoView-browser-compatability.PNG) 
    from MDN Web Docs (Note: any browser with asterisks on scrollIntoView line does NOT support property, any browser with "No" on scrollIntoViewOptions does NOT support property).

- Previous and Next carousel arrows hidden behind the carousel in iPad view (768px in width), disrupting functionality of carousel.
    - After looking in to the issue, bootstrap md class only changed after 767px where as my media query was changing the location of the arrows at 768px, hence the arrows hidden behind
    the carousel cards. Decision was made to make a new media query on line 347 of style.css that made arrow changes at 767px to ensure optimal website functionality for iPad users.

- Placeholder text colour inside of the search input box was not changing to white on Microsoft Edge.
    - After looking in to the issue I discovered that the placeholder pseudo class was not supported on Microsoft Edge by default and instead required ```:-ms=input-placeholder``` pseudo class.
        - Single colon syntax required for Internet Explorer - ```:-ms-input-placeholder```
        - Double colon syntax required for Microsoft Edge - ```::-ms-input-placeholder```

- Active pseudo class content not working on Microsoft Edge 
    - After looking into the issue I discovered that Microsoft Edge was not supporting any colours that had a lower opacity than 1 and if a colour had a lower opacity the colour didn't 
    show at all. To fix the issue I just changed the drop shadow opacity from 0.8 to 1 as after testing I noticed it did not make a noticable difference.

- Search Area background colour was not showing on Microsoft Edge when value was ```#bc7860f7```
    - After looking in to the issue I discovered that Microsoft Edge was not supporting any colours that had a lower opacity than 1 and if a colour had a lower opacity the colour didnt 
    show at all. To fix the issue I removed the "f7" at the end of the colour code as I was satisfied with colour even without the lowered opacity.

- Times not working on forecast carousel card for next 5 days with 3 hour intervals on Safari browser. Instead of showing "Day, Time of Day" it was returning "undefined, NaN:00"
    - After looking into it, I can't say for certain what was causing the issue and what in the function the Safari browser was not supporting but I found a different way of doing the same thing.
    - Instead of using the ```getDays()``` and ```getHours()``` methods, I used the ```toString()``` method to stringify the data timestamp and then used ```split()``` method to be able to target specific parts
    of the timestamp as I was getting errors in my console when I tried to use the split method without converting the date to a string. 
    - I got the day name using indexes after the split method and then I used the ```slice()``` method to get rid of the last colon and seconds in the time so it was 06:00 rather than 06:00:00
    - After figuring out this way of doing things, I realised the code was a lot cleaner as it eliminated the if statements I had before seeing as the getHours and getMinutes methods did not return a 
    0 before a number less than 10 eg was showing as 6:6 rather than 06:06. I then replicated the function without getting the day name and merged the sunSetFunction and sunRiseFunction together to 
    one shorter and cleaner function.

- When onError function is run after there is a user input error caused by an empty input box or misspelled word the API console logs 2 400 or 404 errors depending what user input error occurred.
    - After looking in to it I could find a solution to this as it seems the API does this and can't be stopped however in order to inform the user of the error, the onError function
    is run which manipulates the DOM to add text to the ifError div and red border colour on the input box, informing the user of the error.

- Search functionality not working on Internet explorer making the site unusable on internet explorer.
    - After looking into the issue I noticed the console was not recognising the += in ```output +=``` as valid syntax. Unfortunately due to time limitations I could not find a fix for 
    this issue and has been added to the known bugs section. I also asked my fellow peers, some of whom were also having the same issue.

- ```justify-content: space-evenly;``` does not work on Microsoft Edge or Internet explorer
    - After looking into the issue I checked [caniuse.com]() to find that the css property is not supported on either browsers. The issue was not big so I decided not to make any 
    changes as all that was affected was that the search button and search bar had no space between them and were connected on both browsers.

### Known Bugs
- Search functionality not working on internet explorer. Description in Further Testing section above.
- Scroll function after search only scrolls to halfway down to the div on the original search after page is first loaded. 
    - Function was working correctly originally but something was done that made it stop working, due to time limitations the reason behind the issue could not be found or corrected.
- API is an American API so by default Dublin returns Dublin US, to find Dublin Ireland, "Dublin IE" must be searched. 
    - The API is very picky when it comes to the search functionality. I have tried my best to limit issues by removing spaces in searches and replacing with commas so that the API
    recognizes the search but the API still has a few bugs with search locations, I would change API in the future.
